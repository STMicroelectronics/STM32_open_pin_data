# STM32_open_pin_data

This repo provides all the information required for the **pin configuration** of products based on STM32 MCU.
It is provided as a convenience for pin configuration generation in projects that don't rely on **STM32Cube** or **STM32CubeMx** for this purpose.
The files provided are a subset of STM32CubeMx internal database. They are updated at each new STM32CubeMx version.
As a consequence, this repo is not open to user's contributions, but issues if any can be reported and will be taken into account.
